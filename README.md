# LeetcodeAIPythonPractice
Use AI to give you leetcode problems &amp; tests. Program the answer in Python, ask the AI model to help you if you are stuck and let the AI evaluate your answer.


## Usage

- Configure in your IDE or your console your agent of choice (in my case I am using Gemini CLI + Zed).
- Use the chat to request a different leetcode problem (specify the difficulty if needed).
- Program the solution and test it with `uv run pytest`
- Ask the AI to fix your problem if you are stuck, to explain the best solution or to evaluate yours
